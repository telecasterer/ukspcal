## What This App Does

- Calculates your State Pension Age (SPA) date from your date of birth.
- Builds a payment schedule from your NI suffix and selected cycle.
- Adjusts payments that fall on UK bank holidays to the previous working day.
- Lets you export, print, share, and install the app for easier repeat use.

The tool is designed to help you plan ahead and keep your likely payment dates in one place.

## Data Privacy

- **Your data stays on your device.** Nothing you enter is sent to a server.
- **Settings are saved locally** in your browser storage so the app remembers your choices next time.
- To remove saved data, use **Restore defaults** in the input form.

## Using the App

### Inputs

- **NI code suffix:** Enter the last 3 characters (2 digits and a letter, for example **22D**).
- **Date of birth:** Used to calculate your SPA and estimate your first payment date.
- **Payment frequency:** Choose 28-day (default), 7-day, 14-day, or 91-day cycles.

### Calendar Range and Navigation

- By default, the calendar starts from your first payment month after SPA.
- Choose how many years to include in the generated schedule.
- Use the **Previous/Next** controls above or below the calendar grid to move through month blocks.

### Calendar Display Options

- **UK holidays:** Show or hide UK bank holidays used for early-payment adjustments.
- **Additional holidays:** Optionally show another country/region’s holidays for reference.
  - These additional holidays are informational only and do not change DWP payment dates.
  - They can still be useful if your bank account is outside the UK and local holidays may affect when funds appear.

### Exporting and Printing

- Use **Export** to download:
  - **CSV** for spreadsheet apps.
  - **ICS** for calendar apps (Apple, Google, Outlook, etc.).
- Use **Print** for a paper/PDF version of the calendar.

When exporting ICS:

- Regular payments are exported as a recurring event.
- Early payments (due to bank holidays) are exported as individual events.
- Optional reminders can be included.

This keeps your imported calendar both compact and accurate for early-payment exceptions.

### Installing as an App

- Use the **Install** button when available, or your browser’s **Add to Home Screen / Install App** option.
- ![Example](/help/images/install.png)
- Once installed, all app updates are applied automatically.

## UK Holiday Data

The app uses public holiday data to determine early-payment adjustments.

England & Wales is the default UK holiday set for calculation purposes. Scotland and Northern Ireland are available in additional holidays for reference display.

## About State Pension Age

- The SPA calculation follows published UK government policy.
- If your SPA is before **6 April 2016**, results may be less reliable and a warning is shown.

## Troubleshooting

### In-App Browser Issues

- Printing and exporting may fail in Facebook/Messenger or other in-app browsers.
- For best results, open in Safari/Chrome/Edge/Firefox or install the app.
- If install/print options are missing, use your app/browser menu and choose an option such as **Open in browser**.
