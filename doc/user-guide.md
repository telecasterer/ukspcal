# User Guide: UK State Pension Calendar App

## What is this app?

A free, privacy-first tool to calculate your UK State Pension payment dates, export them, and print your calendar. All calculations happen locally in your browser.

## What you’ll need

- Your **NI code suffix** (last three characters, e.g. `22D`).
- Your **date of birth** (used to estimate State Pension age and the first payment after that age).

## How to use the calculator

1. Enter your NI code suffix and date of birth.
2. Choose your payment cycle (7-day, 14-day, 28-day, or 91-day).
3. Pick the start year and how many years to show.
4. Review the calendar. Early payments (due to weekends/bank holidays) are highlighted.
5. Export or print as needed.

## Exports & downloads

The app supports:

- **CSV export** for spreadsheets.
- **ICS export** for calendar apps (with optional alarms, event titles, category, colour, and event time).
- **Print view** for a paper or PDF copy.

## Holidays and early payments

- The calculator uses official UK bank holidays from GOV.UK.
- If a payment date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, it moves earlier.
- You can optionally overlay additional public holidays for another country (useful if you live abroad).

## Sharing

- Use the **Share** button in the top bar to share the app link or copy it to your clipboard.

## Saved settings & privacy

- Inputs are saved in local storage so you don’t need to re-enter them.
- No data is uploaded to any server.
- Clearing site data in your browser will reset the saved values.

## Accessibility & display tips

- The app supports dark mode and print-friendly layouts.
- If the app is opened inside an in-app browser (e.g. Facebook), you may see limited export/print support—open in Safari/Chrome/Edge for best results.

## Install as an app (PWA)

- On supported browsers, you may see an **Install** button to add the app to your home screen.
- On iOS Safari, use **Share → Add to Home Screen**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Export not working:** Try a different browser or disable ad-blockers.
- **Calendar events show wrong time:** Check your time zone settings in your calendar app.
- **Inputs not saving:** Ensure local storage is enabled for the site.
- **Install button missing:** Some in-app browsers don’t support install; open in Safari/Chrome/Edge.
