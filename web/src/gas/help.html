        <h3>What this tool does</h3>
        <p>
          This tool calculates your UK State Pension payment dates based on
          published payment rules and UK bank holidays.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Calculates payment dates using a repeating payment cycle
            (normally every 28 days).
          </li>
          <li>
            Determines your <strong>normal payment weekday</strong> from the 3 last characters
            of your National Insurance number, e.g. 56D
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjusts payments that would fall on a UK bank holiday
            so that they are paid earlier.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>National Insurance Code</h3>
        <p>
          You must enter:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Just the <strong>last three characters</strong> of your UK National Insurance number
            (for example 56D).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The last three characters are sufficient to determine your normal payment
          weekday.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment cycle</h3>
        <p>
          By default, UK State Pension is paid every 28 days (4 weeks).
          Some people report that alternative payment frequencies
          (such as every 14 days or every 7 days)
          can be arranged by contacting the Pension Service directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default the tool uses a payment cycle of 28 days as this is by far the most common.
          If however you have arranged to be paid every 7 or 14 days then you should select the 
          appropiate payment cycle in the tool.
        </p>
        
        <p class="muted">
          Note: only the 28-day cycle is documented in official GOV.UK guidance.
          Other cycles may depend on individual arrangements with the DWP.
        </p>

        <h3>Date range</h3>
        <p>
          Choose the first and last year you want to include payment dates for.
          Only payment dates that fall within this range are shown.
        </p>

        <h3>Date format</h3>
        <p>
          The date format controls how dates are displayed in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The List view</li>
          <li>List and CSV file exports</li>
        </ul>
    

        <h3>Views</h3>

        <h4>Calendar</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Shows payment dates in a month-by-month calendar</li>
          <li>Payment dates are highlighted</li>
          <li>Weekends and UK bank holidays can be shown or hidden</li>
          <li>
            Early payments are marked with footnotes explaining the reason
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>List</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple chronological list of payment dates</li>
          <li>Early payments include a short explanation</li>
          <li>Designed for easy reading and printing</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CSV</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Suitable for importing into spreadsheets</li>
          <li>Uses your selected date format</li>
          <li>Includes an extra column for early-payment notes when applicable</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>ICS</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Calendar file format you can import into calendar apps like Apple/Google calendars</li>
          <li>Each payment appears as an all-day event</li>
          <li>Early-payment reasons are included where available</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Early payments</h3>
        <p>
          Payments are never made on weekends or UK bank holidays.
          If a payment date would fall on one, it is paid earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          When this happens, the reason is shown:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the Calendar view as a footnote</li>
          <li>In the List view as part of the date line</li>
          <li>In CSV and ICS exports as a note</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Automatic updates</h3>
        <p>
          Changing any of the inputs (NI number, date range, payment cycle,
          or display options) automatically recalculates the payment dates.
          The current view is updated without switching views.
        </p>

        <h3>Important note</h3>
        <p>
          This tool is provided for information and planning purposes only.
          While the calculation logic follows published UK State Pension rules,
          you should always rely on official correspondence from the
          Department for Work and Pensions for confirmation of your payments.
